# Abstract
The aim of the project is to develop a virtual musical instrument for an artistic installation, performance and with educational purposes.
The settings consists of a camera, a system of loudspeakers and a screen.
The system analizes the movements and gestures of the user in order to generate music mapping some features (pitch, tremolo effect,...) and involving the player and the audience with a visual representation on a screen.
The user stands in front of the camera and moves the body in order to control the virtual instrument.
With the hands it controls the melody generation (pitch, the volume and the tremolo) while the entire body it manages higher level music parameters like harmony and rhythm and audio FX.
The visual representation reacts to the inputs given by the camera and shows the notes in a 

## Artistic vision
[Insert here a short description of the artistic vision of your project. What is your audience target? What is the artistic idea you want to convey? The vision can change during the project, but it is important you have one before starting to code]
## Prototype after the hackathon
_Your project should start with a prototype that will implement only the very basic functionalities of your project, and it will serve as a "proof of concept" of your vision._
[Please insert there a bullet point description of the basic functionalities you expect to implement for the first part]

# Final project
[Please insert here a bullet point description of the functionalities you expect to implement for the final presentation of the project. This description is a draft and will serve for the teacher to help you find the right dimension (i.e., number and type of functionalities) for the poroject]
