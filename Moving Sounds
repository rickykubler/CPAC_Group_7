# Abstract
The aim of the project is to develop a virtual musical instrument for an artistic installation, performance and with educational purposes.
The settings consists of a camera, a system of loudspeakers and a screen.
The system analizes the movements and gestures of the user in order to generate music mapping some features (pitch, tremolo effect,...) and involving the player and the audience with a visual representation on a a screen.
The user stands in front of the camera and moves the body in order to control the virtual instrument.
With the hands it controls the melody generation (pitch, the volume and the tremolo) while the entire body it manages higher level music parameters like harmony and rhythm and audio FX.
The visual representation reacts to the inputs given by the camera and shows the notes in a 

## Artistic vision
The idea is that anyone moving his body can be involved by generating music. 
It can be used by an artists in order to make his performance more appealing thanks to the graphic visualization, but it can also have educational purposes in order to teach the sounds of the different grades of the scale
## Prototype after the hackathon 
- Detection of open or close (sound on/off) hand with machine learning;
- Mapping the position in the 2D spaces: on x_axis the volume/tremolo effect and on the y _axis the pitch
- Visualization: a simple piano roll that shows the played notes
- Sounds: real time generation by the use of Max8
