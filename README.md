# BODY SOUND
”Body Sound” is a project whose aim is to develop a virtual musical instrument for an artistic installation.<br/><br/>
It can be used by an artist in order to make his performance more appealing thanks to the graphic visualization, but it can also have educational purposes to teach the sounds of the different grades of the scale.<br/><br/>
The system uses a sensor (camera) that receives information from the external real environment and then a visual representation reacts to the inputs given by showing a graphic representation on a screen and playing some sounds.

## Installation
Download this repository and all the specific software:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Max8](https://cycling74.com/downloads)
* [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/Install_TouchDesigner)

Write these lines on Visual Studio Code's terminal.
* Upgrade PIP:
```bash
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
* Activate the virtual environment: 
```bash
.\project-venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
.\magenta-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
* Create the env (Windows): 
```bash
py -m venv project-venv
```
* Create the env (Mac):
```bash
-m venv project-venv
```

## How to use
Unless you have a superhero computer, in order to use the software it is suggested to use at least two computers so as to have more memory to use.
Open all the files in their dedicated programs and run them contemporarily since it is a real-time project:
* *PincoPallino* file with Visual Studio Code
* *Ciaone* file with Max8
* *CeLaFaremo* file with TouchDesigner

## Instructions
Qui inseriremo delle istruzioni generali una volta fatte le mappature.
